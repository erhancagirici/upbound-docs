This guide provides an overview of Kubernetes role-based access control (RBAC) in Upbound. RBAC allows you to regulate access to your Upbound resources and control planes based on the roles of individual users within your organization.

### Enable Kubernetes Hub authorization

To enable Kubernetes Hub Authentication in your Space, you need:
- A Kubernetes cluster with RBAC enabled
- `authorization.hubRBAC` set to `true` (enabled by default)

Users can authenticate to the single-tenant Space with their Kubernetes credentials using this method.

### Configure Kubernetes RBAC

To configure Kubernetes RBAC in your Disconnected Space, you need to create `ClusterRoles` and `Roles` for defining access to your resources. For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: controlplane-getter
rules:
- apiGroups: ["spaces.upbound.io"]
  resources: ["controlplanes"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
```

Next, create `ClusterRoleBindings` and `RoleBindings` to assign roles to subjects like users, groups, or service accounts:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: controlplane-getters
subjects:
- kind: User
  name: upbound:(user|robot):<username>
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: controlplane-getter
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

The `subject` in this example can contain teams (`upbound:team:<uuid>`) or org roles (`upbound:org-role:admin|member`) depending on your role needs.

You can use the special verbs `admin`, `edit` and `view` for giving a subject access to a control plane:
```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: controlplane-editor
rules:
- apiGroups: ["spaces.upbound.io"]
  resources: ["controlplanes/k8s"]
  verbs: ["edit"] # or "admin" or "view", depending on access level
```
<!-- vale Google.WordList = NO -->
