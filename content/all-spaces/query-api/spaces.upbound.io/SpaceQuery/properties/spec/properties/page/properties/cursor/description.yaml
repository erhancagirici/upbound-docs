    cursor is the cursor of the first object to return. This value is opaque,
    the format cannot be relied on. It is returned by the server in the
    response to a previous query. If neither first nor cursor is specified,
    objects are returned from the beginning.
    
    
    Note that cursor values are not stable under different orderings.
