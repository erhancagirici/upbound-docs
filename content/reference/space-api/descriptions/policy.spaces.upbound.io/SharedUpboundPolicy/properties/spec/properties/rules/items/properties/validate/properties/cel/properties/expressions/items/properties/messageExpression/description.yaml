    messageExpression declares a CEL expression that evaluates to the validation failure message that is returned when this rule fails.
    Since messageExpression is used as a failure message, it must evaluate to a string.
    If both message and messageExpression are present on a validation, then messageExpression will be used if validation fails.
    If messageExpression results in a runtime error, the runtime error is logged, and the validation failure message is produced
    as if the messageExpression field were unset. If messageExpression evaluates to an empty string, a string with only spaces, or a string
    that contains line breaks, then the validation failure message will also be produced as if the messageExpression field were unset, and
    the fact that messageExpression produced an empty string/string with only spaces/string with line breaks will be logged.
    messageExpression has access to all the same variables as the `expression` except for 'authorizer' and 'authorizer.requestResource'.
    Example:
    'object.x must be less than max ('+string(params.max)+')'
