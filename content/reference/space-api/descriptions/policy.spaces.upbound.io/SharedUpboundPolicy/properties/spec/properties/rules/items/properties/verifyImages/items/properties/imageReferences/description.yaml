    ImageReferences is a list of matching image reference patterns. At least one pattern in the
    list must match the image for the rule to apply. Each image reference consists of a registry
    address (defaults to docker.io), repository, image, and tag (defaults to latest).
    Wildcards ('*' and '?') are allowed. See: https://kubernetes.io/docs/spaces/containers/images.
