    `parameterNotFoundAction` controls the behavior of the binding when the resource
    exists, and name or selector is valid, but there are no parameters
    matched by the binding. If the value is set to `Allow`, then no
    matched parameters will be treated as successful validation by the binding.
    If set to `Deny`, then no matched parameters will be subject to the
    `failurePolicy` of the policy.
    
    
    Allowed values are `Allow` or `Deny`
    Default to `Deny`
