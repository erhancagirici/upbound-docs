    Keys is a set of X.509 public keys used to verify image signatures. The keys can be directly
    specified or can be a variable reference to a key specified in a ConfigMap (see
    https://kyverno.io/docs/writing-policies/variables/), or reference a standard Kubernetes Secret
    elsewhere in the cluster by specifying it in the format 'k8s://<namespace>/<secret_name>'.
    The named Secret must specify a key `cosign.pub` containing the public key used for
    verification, (see https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/blob/main/KMS.md#kubernetes-secret).
    When multiple keys are specified each key is processed as a separate staticKey entry
    (.attestors[*].entries.keys) within the set of attestors and the count is applied across the keys.
