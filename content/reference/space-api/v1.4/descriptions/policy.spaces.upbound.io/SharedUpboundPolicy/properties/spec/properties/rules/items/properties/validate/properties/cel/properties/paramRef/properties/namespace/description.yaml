    namespace is the namespace of the referenced resource. Allows limiting
    the search for params to a specific namespace. Applies to both `name` and
    `selector` fields.
    
    
    A per-namespace parameter may be used by specifying a namespace-scoped
    `paramKind` in the policy and leaving this field empty.
    
    
    - If `paramKind` is cluster-scoped, this field MUST be unset. Setting this
    field results in a configuration error.
    
    
    - If `paramKind` is namespace-scoped, the namespace of the object being
    evaluated for admission will be used when this field is left unset. Take
    care that if this is left empty the binding must not match any cluster-scoped
    resources, which will result in an error.
