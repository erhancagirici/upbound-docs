    key specifies the audit annotation key. The audit annotation keys of
    a ValidatingAdmissionPolicy must be unique. The key must be a qualified
    name ([A-Za-z0-9][-A-Za-z0-9_.]*) no more than 63 bytes in length.
    
    
    The key is combined with the resource name of the
    ValidatingAdmissionPolicy to construct an audit annotation key:
    '{ValidatingAdmissionPolicy name}/{key}'.
    
    
    If an admission webhook uses the same resource name as this ValidatingAdmissionPolicy
    and the same audit annotation key, the annotation key will be identical.
    In this case, the first annotation written with the key will be included
    in the audit event and all subsequent annotations with the same key
    will be discarded.
    
    
    Required.
