    ApplyRules controls how rules in a policy are applied. Rule are processed in
    the order of declaration. When set to `One` processing stops after a rule has
    been applied i.e. the rule matches and results in a pass, fail, or error. When
    set to `All` all rules in the policy are processed. The default is `All`.
