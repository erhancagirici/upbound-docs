    valueExpression represents the expression which is evaluated by CEL to
    produce an audit annotation value. The expression must evaluate to either
    a string or null value. If the expression evaluates to a string, the
    audit annotation is included with the string value. If the expression
    evaluates to null or empty string the audit annotation will be omitted.
    The valueExpression may be no longer than 5kb in length.
    If the result of the valueExpression is more than 10kb in length, it
    will be truncated to 10kb.
    
    
    If multiple ValidatingAdmissionPolicyBinding resources match an
    API request, then the valueExpression will be evaluated for
    each binding. All unique values produced by the valueExpressions
    will be joined together in a comma-separated list.
    
    
    Required.
