    Selector is a label selector. Label keys and values in `matchLabels` support the wildcard
    characters `*` (matches zero or many characters) and `?` (matches one character).
    Wildcards allows writing label selectors like ['storage.k8s.io/*': '*']. Note that
    using ['*' : '*'] matches any key and value but does not match an empty label set.
