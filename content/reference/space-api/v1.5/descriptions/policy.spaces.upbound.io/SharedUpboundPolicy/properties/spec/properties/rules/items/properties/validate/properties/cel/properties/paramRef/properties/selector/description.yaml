    selector can be used to match multiple param objects based on their labels.
    Supply selector: {} to match all resources of the ParamKind.

    and the results are ANDed together.
    
    
    One of `name` or `selector` must be set, but `name` and `selector` are
    mutually exclusive properties. If one is set, the other must be unset.
