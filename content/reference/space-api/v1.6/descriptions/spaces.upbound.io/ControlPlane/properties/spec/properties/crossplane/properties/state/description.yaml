    State defines the state for crossplane and provider workloads. We support
    the following states where 'Running' is the default:
    - Running: Starts/Scales up all crossplane and provider workloads in the ControlPlane
    - Paused: Pauses/Scales down all crossplane and provider workloads in the ControlPlane
