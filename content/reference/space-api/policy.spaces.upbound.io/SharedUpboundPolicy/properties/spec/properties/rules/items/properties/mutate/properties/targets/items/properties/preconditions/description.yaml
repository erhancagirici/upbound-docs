    Preconditions are used to determine if a policy rule should be applied by evaluating a
    set of conditions. The declaration can contain nested `any` or `all` statements. A direct list
    of conditions (without `any` or `all` statements is supported for backwards compatibility but
    will be deprecated in the next major release.
