    JMESPath is an optional JSON Match Expression that can be used to
    transform the JSON response returned from the server. For example
    a JMESPath of 'items | length(@)' applied to the API server response
    for the URLPath '/apis/apps/v1/deployments' will return the total count
    of deployments across all namespaces.
