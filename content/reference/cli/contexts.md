description: An introduction to the how contexts work in Upbound

Crossplane and Upbound emerged out of the Kubernetes ecosystem. The up CLI's command structure and syntax is strongly inspired by Kubernetes contexts and the conventions of the Kubernetes `kubectl` CLI.

## Contexts in Upbound

Upbound's information architecture is a hierarchy consisting of:

<!-- vale off -->
* a set of managed control planes
* logically grouped into control planes groups
* which are hosted in an environment called a [Space]({{<ref "/all-spaces" >}}).

These contexts nest within each other. An MCP must **always** belong to a group which **must** be hosted in a Space--whether Cloud, Connected, or Disconnected.
<!--vale on -->

Every managed control plane in Upbound has its own API server. Each Space likewise offers a set of APIs that you can manage things through, exposed as a [Kubernetes-compatible API]({{<ref "/reference/space-api/" >}}). This means there's two relevant contextual scopes you interact with often: a **Spaces context** and a **control plane context**.

In `up`, the commands you can execute are context-sensitive.

## The 'up ctx' command
<!--vale on -->

In `up`, the `up ctx` sub-command is a single command that can used across all deployments of Upbound to set a kubecontext. You can use this kubecontext to drive interactions via `kubectl` or it's used during the execution of other `up` CLI commands.

### Interactive terminal UI

The default experience for `up ctx` is a terminal UI like [kubectx](https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectx/).

When interacting with managed control planes that are hosted in:

* **a Cloud Space:** always make sure you're logged into Upbound with `up login` before trying to use `up ctx`.
* **a Connected or Disconnected Space:** always make sure your current kubecontext is pointed at the cluster which hosts your Space.
{{< /hint >}}

The following are some tips for using the terminal UI:

* Use the arrow keys or hotkeys to navigate around the hierarchy within Upbound. Pressing the right arrow button attempts to navigate you **into** a context. Pressing the left arrow button attempts to navigate you **out** of the current context into the parent context.
* Use the `Q` key to quit and set the context you're in as the current kubecontext.
* Use the `escape` key to quit and cancel changing your kubecontext.

### Non-interactive navigation

You can also use `up ctx` in a non-interactive mode to navigate around the information hierarchy in Upbound. This form of navigation works in similar fashion to navigating a file system from a CLI.

Suppose you start with your context pointed at a Space:

```shell
up ctx .
# returns acme/upbound-gcp-us-west1
```

To traverse to a group, you can use a relative path:

```shell
up ctx ./my-group
# returns acme/upbound-gcp-us-west1/my-group
```

To return to the previous level in the hierarchy, you can use `..`:

```shell
up ctx ..
# returns acme/upbound-gcp-us-west1
```

If you're connecting to multiple control planes and want to hop between them, you can do the following:

```shell
up ctx acme/upbound-gcp-us-west1/my-group/ctp1
# Set context to ctp1

up ctx acme/upbound-gcp-us-west1/other-group/ctp2
# Set context to ctp2

up ctx -
# Resets context to previous context, ctp1

up ctx -
# Resets context to previous context, ctp2
```

### Storing a context to a file

Instead of selecting a context and making it your current kubecontext, you can also print the context out to a kubeconfig file. Run the following:

```shell
# This saves an MCP's connection details to a kubeconfig
up ctx <your-org>/<your-space>/<your-group>/<your-ctp> -f - > context.yaml

# This saves a Space's connection details to a kubeconfig
up ctx <your-org>/<your-space> -f - > context.yaml

# This saves whatever the current context is to a kubeconfig
up ctx . -f - > context.yaml
```

### Print the current context

If you get lost in the navigation hierarchy, you can print the current context to the screen with the following command:

```shell
up ctx .
```
